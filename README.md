# Cruise_Control_System

Cruise control (sometimes known as speed control or autocruise, or tempomat in some countries) is a system that automatically controls the speed of a motor vehicle. The system is a servomechanism that takes over the throttle of the car to maintain a steady speed as set by the driver.

In this Project we have simulated a cruise control system for a vehicle which when operated will ask for a speed to be entered and then the system will give out a response and through this project we can see the response of the system and wether or not the system will attain the speed given by the user and how much will it take to attain such input speed.
